      +# The Higgs Mechanism and the Origin of Mass
      +
      +Target duration ~12–13 minutes for a physics-savvy audience (advanced undergraduates or researchers) to trace the mass problem through the Higgs mechanism and its experimental confirmation.
      +
      +## High-Level Story Spine
      +- Open with the puzzle of why particles are not all massless despite relativistic expectations.
      +- Show that gauge symmetry forbids naive mass terms, creating tension with observed massive particles.
      +- Introduce spontaneous symmetry breaking with a scalar potential as a way to hide symmetry without breaking the laws.
      +- Present the Higgs field as the electroweak solution that gives gauge bosons and fermions mass while preserving gauge invariance.
